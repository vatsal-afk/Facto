### Benefits of Verification 🌟

- **Contribute Meaningfully** 🌐: Verified users can vote to determine whether news is real or fake.
  
- **Build Credibility** 🏆: Verified status enhances your recognition as a trustworthy participant.

- **Support Accuracy** 📊: Your verified status helps improve the quality of news verification.
----------

### Voting feature:

For getting the feedback of the generalist and verified user we will have the voting feature for the verdict that is being generated by the server, and here is a quick walkthrough for that:

<p align="center">

Just click on the upvote and downvote option to express your required sentiments.

## Web Scraping for Recent News

<p align="center">
  <img src="app_screenshots/image4.png" alt="App Screenshot">
</p>

This feature collects and analyzes the latest news articles from reliable sources like The Guardian, Reddit, and News API. Using libraries like **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing, **Requests** for HTTP requests, and **praw** for accessing Reddit’s API, the platform retrieves diverse and up-to-date content. The data is then processed for analysis and insights, ensuring relevant news is always available for verification.

# About the Models

## 1. 📰Fake News Verification Model

This model verifies the authenticity of news by comparing custom inputs to trusted sources. It uses advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** and **embedding-based similarity** checks to assess the credibility of news claims.

### ✨Key Features:

-   🔗**Embedding-Based Comparison**: Compares news input embeddings with external sources to check for similarities.
-   📚**Fact Density**: Measures the factual depth of news to detect sensationalism.
-   🔤**Lexical Diversity**: Assesses vocabulary richness to flag repetitive or overly simplified language.
-   😊**Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates emotional bias in the content, aiming for neutrality.
-   📖**Readability**: Ensures content is clear and not oversimplified.

### ⚙️How It Works:

1.  ✍️**Input News**: Custom news input is provided.
2.  🧠**Embedding Extraction**: The input is transformed into embeddings.
3.  🔍**Similarity Check**: The model compares the embeddings to trusted sources.
4.  🔧**Refinement**: Additional parameters (fact density, sentiment, etc.) refine the decision.
5.  ✅**Output**: The model returns a **credibility score** and a **verdict** (real or fake).

### 📊 Visual Output:

-   Bar charts and interactive symbols display scores for each parameter, providing a clear visual summary of the news verification process.
-   Knowledge graph for getting the sense out of the news.

### 🚀 Features

- **🎵 Audio Extraction**  
  Extract audio directly from YouTube videos using `youtube-dlp`.  

- **📄 Whisper for Transcription**  
  Convert audio to text with high accuracy using the **Whisper model**.  

- **📝 News Chunking**  
  Break transcribed text into smaller, context-specific chunks for efficient analysis.  

- **❌✅ Fake News Classification**  
  Analyze and classify news chunks as **real** or **fake** using trusted source comparison.  

- **⏳ Timestamp Flexibility**  
  Start analyzing from a specific timestamp for focused evaluations.
