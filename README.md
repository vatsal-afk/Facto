# About the Models

## 1. Fake News Verification Model

This model verifies the authenticity of news by comparing custom inputs to trusted sources. It uses advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** and **embedding-based similarity** checks to assess the credibility of news claims.

### Key Features:

-   **Embedding-Based Comparison**: Compares news input embeddings with external sources to check for similarities.
-   **Fact Density**: Measures the factual depth of news to detect sensationalism.
-   **Lexical Diversity**: Assesses vocabulary richness to flag repetitive or overly simplified language.
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates emotional bias in the content, aiming for neutrality.
-   **Readability**: Ensures content is clear and not oversimplified.

### How It Works:

1.  **Input News**: Custom news input is provided.
2.  **Embedding Extraction**: The input is transformed into embeddings.
3.  **Similarity Check**: The model compares the embeddings to trusted sources.
4.  **Refinement**: Additional parameters (fact density, sentiment, etc.) refine the decision.
5.  **Output**: The model returns a **credibility score** and a **verdict** (real or fake).

### Visual Output:

-   Bar charts and interactive symbols display scores for each parameter, providing a clear visual summary of the news verification process.

## 2. Live News Verification from YouTube

This model verifies news from YouTube videos using a multi-step process that extracts audio, transcribes it, and analyzes the content for authenticity. It relies on advanced **audio-to-text transcription** and **NLP-based chunking** to evaluate the news in smaller, context-specific pieces.

![App Screenshot](app_screenshots/image5.png)

### Key Features:

-   **Audio Extraction**: Uses `youtube-dlp` to convert video content into audio.
-   **Whisper for Transcription**: Transcribes the audio into text using the Whisper model.
-   **News Chunking**: Breaks transcribed text into meaningful chunks for easier analysis.
-   **Fake News Classification**: Classifies news as real or fake based on similarity to trusted sources.
-   **Timestamp Flexibility**: Allows users to select a starting timestamp for targeted analysis.

### How It Works:

1.  **Input Video**: Upload the YouTube video to be analyzed.
2.  **Audio Conversion**: Extracts audio using `youtube-dlp`.
3.  **Audio Transcription**: Transcribes the audio to text using Whisper.
4.  **Content Chunking**: Breaks the transcription into chunks for detailed analysis.
5.  **Verification**: Each chunk is analyzed for authenticity and classified accordingly.
6.  **Timestamp Selection**: Users can specify where to start analyzing the video.
