functionaries and party workers have either been arrested or they've been placed under
house arrest by the police that is the charge coming in from the side of the Tamil
police.
Anamalai is with Ashilpa coming back to you in a moment from Anamalai a serious charge
that your party is making.
What has happened here please tell us are the women workers of the BJP being prevented
from protesting what's going on?
Madam our BJP Magila Mocha our workers they've decided to undertake a food march starting
from Madurai to Chennai and the food march was supposed to start today morning and they
will take about three four days to reach Chennai and then submit a memorandum to the
hauntable governor of Tamil Nadu.
Unfortunately right from yesterday midnight the police people illegally unauthorizedly they've
gone to all our office there at houses, kept them under house arrest allowing them not
to come outside their home and we have put out some photos also and across Tamil Nadu
they don't want one office bearers to come towards Madurai even in Madurai it is almost
like 2000 find that policemen deploy not allowing women workers to even to talk to kind
of march and this is completely precognizant when it's a peaceful march when we have submitted
to the police commissioner when we have told Asim that we will obey by all the rules
and regulations but impregnate to somebody's home keeping police right outside their home
not allowing the besiepper who said that home is absolutely precognizant.
The expectation from the government what is your plea to the government now what is the
BJP expecting?
If they still the chief minister, the deputy chief minister they're ready to come out talk
to the press about the serious allegations you have kept on the party.
The primary accused in this case is the BMQ office bearer and till now they don't acknowledge
it they haven't even suspended the primary accused from the party and they should repeat
off and no questions are being asked about why they don't know what's kept on them and
even in the victims the FIR that is filed she has made allegations very clearly that I
choose for speaking somebody about stir and as you want.
